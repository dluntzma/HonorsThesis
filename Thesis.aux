The light is then passed through a doubler so the wavelength is $430$ nm and then another doubler so the wavelength is the required $215$ nm. The $215$ nm light is then coupled into an optical cavity within a vacuum chamber where the $215$ nm light is focused. The krypton atoms are directed through a capillary plate and through the optical cavity perpendicular to the $215$ nm light.\relax }}{4}{}}
