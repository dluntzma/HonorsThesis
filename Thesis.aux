Atoms are excited from the $4p^6$ $^1S_0$ state using two-photons to the $5p_{[3/2]_2}$ state then they decay either back to the $4p^6$ $^1S_0$ state or to the $5s_{[3/2]_2}$ state. Atoms can be ionized from both the $5s_{[3/2]_2}$ state and the $5p_{[3/2]_2}$ state.}}{2}{}}

Finally, the red line is the calculation using both the gaussian intensity profile and the Maxwell velocity distribution. The root-mean-square velocity is a good approximation; the green and red lines are very close. The constant intensity is not as good an approximation for the more accurate gaussian intensity profile, note the differences between blue line and the green line.}}{8}{}}
